I have worked on A1's F8. Added a packaging, versioning and releasing workflow to both the app and model-service repositories, that parses the version from the app repo's pom.xml and releases the container images of both to the GitHub registry.

- Rodrigo: https://github.com/doda25-team11/model-service/pull/5 & https://github.com/doda25-team11/model-service/pull/3

I have worked on A1's F9 and F10. Add a workflow to train the ML model, and removed the hard coded model from the dockerfile.

- Arnas: https://github.com/doda25-team11/lib-version

I worked on versioning and deployment of the lib-version. All commits there are mine this week. I worked on F1, F2 and F11.

- Figen: https://github.com/doda25-team11/operation/pull/1

I have worked on A1's F7, writing the docker-compose file to onfiguring services, environment variables, networking, volume mapping.

- Amy: https://github.com/doda25-team11/model-service/pull/2 & https://github.com/doda25-team11/model-service/pull/6

I worked on F4 and F6, making sure multiple architectures are supported and being able to set the ports (both frontend and backend) manually.

- Bill: https://github.com/doda25-team11/app/pull/1 & https://github.com/doda25-team11/model-service/pull/1

I worked on F3 and F5. Running the frontend and backend outside the containers, then I analysed the working of the backend with POSTMAN. Then I containerise the frontend and the backend (backend with multi-stage). 

I code reviewed: https://github.com/doda25-team11/model-service/pull/2 & https://github.com/doda25-team11/model-service/pull/3 & https://github.com/doda25-team11/app/pull/2

I implemented steps 9 till 12 with the two PRs and tested this.

I code reviewed: https://github.com/doda25-team11/operation/pull/2

NOTE: I helped Amy with her step 15 because that didn't work. She couldn't figure it out so I implemented the fixes in her PR.

- Amy: https://github.com/doda25-team11/operation/pull/7
I worked on step 13-17. There were some troubles with copying the admin file to the host, so I got some help with that. I reviewed/tested steps 4-8. 

- Rodrigo: https://github.com/doda25-team11/operation/pull/3
I worked on steps 4-8 and reviewed steps 1-3. I also worked on fixing F10 because it still used 'latest' (although this PR was merged in Week 4)

- Radu: https://github.com/doda25-team11/operation/pull/11

I have assigned myself to complete the last steps of A2 (20-23), and only got to work on them in W4 because the repo was not yet in a state where we were confident there were no task dependencies affecting steps 20-23

- Rodrigo: https://github.com/doda25-team11/operation/pull/8 + PR mentioned in the previous week
I implemented the helm chart and part of the migration. I code reviewed PRs related to Steps 16-17 and 20-21
