- Radu: https://github.com/doda25-team11/app/pull/3 & https://github.com/doda25-team11/model-service/pull/4

I have worked on A1's F8. Added a packaging, versioning and releasing workflow to both the app and model-service repositories, that parses the version from the app repo's pom.xml and releases the container images of both to the GitHub registry.

- Rodrigo: https://github.com/doda25-team11/model-service/pull/5 & https://github.com/doda25-team11/model-service/pull/3

I have worked on A1's F9 and F10. Add a workflow to train the ML model, and removed the hard coded model from the dockerfile.

- Arnas: https://github.com/doda25-team11/lib-version

I worked on versioning and deployment of the lib-version. All commits there are mine this week. I worked on F1, F2 and F11.

- Figen: https://github.com/doda25-team11/operation

I have worked on A1's F7, writing the docker-compose file to onfiguring services, environment variables, networking, volume mapping.

- Amy: https://github.com/doda25-team11/model-service/pull/2 & https://github.com/doda25-team11/model-service/pull/6

I worked on F4 and F6, making sure multiple architectures are supported and being able to set the ports (both frontend and backend) manually.

- Bill: https://github.com/doda25-team11/app/pull/1 & https://github.com/doda25-team11/model-service/pull/1

I worked on F3 and F5. Running the frontend and backend outside the containers, then I analysed the working of the backend with POSTMAN. Then I containerise the frontend and the backend (backend with multi-stage). 

I code reviewed: https://github.com/doda25-team11/model-service/pull/2 & https://github.com/doda25-team11/model-service/pull/3 & https://github.com/doda25-team11/app/pull/2

NOTE: I helped Amy with F6 and tested the code with her.

I implemented steps 9 till 12 with the two PRs and tested this.

I code reviewed: https://github.com/doda25-team11/operation/pull/2
